I found the best prices for my dress apparel line production in no time. Allowed me to reduce manufacturing costs by almost 200%

Finding Sewport saved my business. After my manufacturer closed down I could not find a quality supplier for ages. I took me less than 48hours to find a new one here.

I like that I can manage the processes and communicate with my suppliers directly. This is the exact no-agent model the fashion industry needs.

1) Design,Sketch Process
Firstly finialize the sketch design as well as creating the product specification. We will move to next step for sample processing.

2) Fabrics & Trims Decision
Now, here we will define the materials that we will need to use for above garment.Here we also offer job work so the buyer can aslo supply or suggest their desired fabric. Here we will aslo decide components like trims,zips, buttons.

3) Pattern Making
Pattern making is a process of making template pieces of a garment. Usually. cut out from the thick paper or created digitally with software, these templates are later used in cutting out specific parts of clothes from fabrics.

4) Sample Piece
Once the above three steps are confirmed we will create a sample piece as per planning where our pattern master and workers will be involved as they have to take work from here.

5) Sizing & Fitting
Once our sample is approved and we are ready to make production here we will make patterns for different sizes as per requirement, where we will create different length, waist, inseam, etc.

6) Bulk Production & Quality Control
The final and the last step after finializing the garment is the bulk production. Here, we are not only producing the final garment but quality control is also being maintained.
